      content: `IPv6 addresses are organized into three main categories:

- **Unicast**: One-to-one communication (most common)
- **Multicast**: One-to-many communication  
- **Anycast**: One-to-nearest communication

Unlike IPv4, IPv6 has no broadcast addresses. Multicast handles broadcast-like functions.`

  anycast: {
    title: "Anycast Addresses",
    description: `Anycast addresses look identical to unicast addresses but are assigned to multiple devices. Traffic goes to the "nearest" device with that address.

There's no special prefix for anycast - they use the same ranges as unicast addresses.`,
    
    commonUses: [
      "DNS root servers (multiple servers, same IP)",
      "Content delivery networks (CDNs)",
      "Load balancing across geographic locations",
      "Subnet router anycast (all routers on a subnet)"

    example: "2001:db8::1 could be anycast if assigned to multiple servers"
  },

  reservedRanges: [
    { prefix: "0000::/8", purpose: "Reserved (includes ::1 and IPv4-mapped)" },
    { prefix: "0100::/8", purpose: "Reserved" },

  quickTips: [
    "Most public IPv6 addresses start with 2 or 3",
    "If you see fe80::, it's link-local (not routed)",
    "If you see fd or fc, it's unique local (private)",
    "If you see ff, it's multicast",
    "::1 is IPv6 loopback (like 127.0.0.1)",
    ":: means all zeros (like 0.0.0.0)"
