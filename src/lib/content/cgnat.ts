    overview: {
      title: "What is Carrier-Grade NAT?",
      content: `Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) is a large-scale NAT implementation used by ISPs to share a single public IPv4 address among multiple customers. It's also called Large Scale NAT (LSN) or NAT444.

CGNAT became necessary due to IPv4 address exhaustion - there simply aren't enough public IPv4 addresses for every device to have its own.`
    },

    why: {
      title: "Why Do ISPs Use CGNAT?",
      content: `ISPs use CGNAT because:
- IPv4 addresses are expensive and scarce
- Customer demand for internet connectivity continues to grow
- Each customer may have multiple devices needing internet access
- Transitioning to IPv6 takes time and planning

CGNAT allows ISPs to serve more customers with fewer public IPv4 addresses.`
