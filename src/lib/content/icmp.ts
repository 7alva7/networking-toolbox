      content: `ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used by network devices to send error messages and operational information. It's not used for data transfer, but rather for network diagnostics and error reporting.

ICMPv6 serves the same purpose for IPv6 networks, but also handles additional functions like Neighbor Discovery that ARP handles in IPv4.`
