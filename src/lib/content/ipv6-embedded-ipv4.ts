      content: `During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, several mechanisms were created to embed or reference IPv4 addresses within IPv6 addresses. These help with compatibility, tunneling, and gradual migration.

Most of these are legacy mechanisms, but you'll still encounter them in network troubleshooting and configuration.`
