      title: "What is an Autonomous System (AS)?",
      content: `An Autonomous System (AS) is a collection of IP networks and routers under the control of one organization that presents a common routing policy to the internet. Each AS is identified by a unique number called an ASN (Autonomous System Number).

Think of an AS as an independent piece of the internet - like an ISP, a large company, or a university - that can make its own decisions about how to route traffic.`

    asn: {
      title: "ASN (Autonomous System Number)",
      content: `ASNs are unique numbers that identify each Autonomous System. They work like postal codes for internet routing - they help routers know which organization controls which IP addresses.

ASNs are assigned by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and are essential for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing.`
