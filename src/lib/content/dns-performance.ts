			title: 'Why DNS Performance Matters',
			content: `DNS (Domain Name System) performance directly impacts how fast websites and applications load. Every time you visit a website, your device must first query a DNS resolver to translate the domain name into an IP address. This lookup happens before any content can be downloaded.

A slow DNS resolver can add hundreds of milliseconds to every page load, making websites feel sluggish even on fast internet connections. By testing and choosing the fastest resolver for your location, you can significantly improve your browsing experience.`,
