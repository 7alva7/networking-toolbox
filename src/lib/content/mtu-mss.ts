      title: "MTU vs MSS",
      content: `MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is the largest packet size that can be transmitted over a network link without fragmentation. MSS (Maximum Segment Size) is the largest amount of TCP data that can be sent in a single segment.

The relationship is: MSS = MTU - IP Header - TCP Header
For IPv4: MSS = MTU - 20 - 20 = MTU - 40 bytes`
